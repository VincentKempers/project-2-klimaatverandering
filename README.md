# klimaatverandering

This storytelling project is an interactive questionnaire that gives you a score about 'how climatefriendly are you, when you eat?'.

This project is aimed at children in college (juniors). They are fairly young and smart. Live with their parents and don't really have the concept of "what food could do to the enviroment".

There is a set route in this project. 
Bread - cheese - milk
